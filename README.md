This repository contains the source code for my Master's thesis titled [BRCA:Cohort-vs-TCGA: a webtool for comprehensive exploration and comparison of mutational landscape of breast cancer cohorts with TCGA-BRCA](https://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/items/785c7695-78d9-4513-bf70-6c363094deae). In short, this webtool, developed with [Shiny framework](https://shiny.posit.co/) of RStudio allows the users to upload the mutations belonging to their breast cancer cohort for analysing and comparing them to a gold-standard cancer cohort called [TCGA-BRCA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA). You can see a short demo below:
